 This program also included developer-focused AI school that provided a bunch of assets to help build AI skills.  Envisioned as a three-year collaborative program, Intelligent Cloud Hub will support around 100 institutions with AI infrastructure, course content and curriculum, developer support, development tools and give students access to cloud and AI services.  The company will provide AI development tools and Azure AI services such as Microsoft Cognitive Services, Bot Services and Azure Machine Learning.  Earlier in April this year, the company announced Microsoft Professional Program In AI as a learning track open to the public.  This will require more collaborations and training and working with AI.  As part of the program, the Redmond giant which wants to expand its reach and is planning to build a strong developer ecosystem in India with the program will set up the core AI infrastructure and IoT Hub for the selected campuses.  Thatâ€™s why it has become more critical than ever for educational institutions to integrate new cloud and AI technologies
